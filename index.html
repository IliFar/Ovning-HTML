        <h1>Tokyo</h1>
        <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, it is situated on the central Pacific coast of Japan's main island of Honshu.
            <br>
            Food, traditions, technology and the building style of the city are of the many reasons why i like Tokyo and
            would like to visit it one day. Tokyo has a mix of both the modern world and the traditions of Japan from
            the high skyscrapers to historic temples. To get to see this mix is in my todolist.

            Regarding my experience in programming, i would say it is a very humble experience, i have built a landing
            e-commerce website including the head, the body and a footer using HTML5, CSS3 and like 7 lines of
            Javascript. I have also built a console app calculator and a guessing game in both Python and C#.
